### Have you already trained your custom model?

If so, this notebook will help you make a simple API call to OCR a test form and then parse the result.

If you still need to create your model, you can use the Document Intelligence Studio:  
https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio 

Just follow this guide:  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/build-a-custom-model?view=doc-intel-4.0.0

If you need some sample forms, there are some very basic ones in the \sample_forms folder.  

After creating the your trained custom model, come back here to write some python code.
